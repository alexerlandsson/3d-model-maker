# CSS Voxel Studio

Simple tool to create pixelated 3D models (voxels) in HTML and CSS based on two Pens I created on *CodePen*:
- [3D Model Maker (Core)](https://codepen.io/alexerlandsson/pen/bNGJWBR)
- [3D Model Maker (Crossy Road)](https://codepen.io/alexerlandsson/pen/pvoBPdK)

This version is an extension of the original idea, where you can create a voxel model by placing cuboids in a 3D space. The cuboids are rendered using CSS and can be moved around in 3D space.
